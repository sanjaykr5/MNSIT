# Introduction to Tensorflow,  and Tensorboard

This repository contains how to build a Convolutional Neural Network with Tensorflow.
The Notebook consists 4 parts:
  -  Data Preprocessing
  -  Defining CNN architecture 
  -  Training the Model
  -  Visualising Tensorboard Graph and Scalars

## CNN Overview

[Convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep, feed-forward artificial neural networks that has successfully been applied to analyzing visual imagery.


  
## Dataset Introduction
The Dataset used here is  MNIST handwritten digits from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data) . The dataset contains 42000 examples for training and 28,000 examples for testing.
